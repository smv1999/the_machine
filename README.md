"Where's the Machine now?"

"What the drives, who knows? Government facility somewhere but The Machine.
The Machine is everywhere, watching us with ten thousand eyes, listening with a million ears." 

Meet The Machine !

This project is inspired by "The Machine" shown in the series "Person of Interest". The idea is to create a miniature clone of the machine.
